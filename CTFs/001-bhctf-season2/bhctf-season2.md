``` As the captain of Team U-niverse, I participated to the Block Harbor x VicOne Automotive CTF Season 2 (2024). We couldn't make it to the final rounds. It was, however, a chance for us to learn new things. Personally, I was able to sharpen my reverse engineering skill a little bit. Here under I will place write-ups for the RE challenges that I solved. ```

### 1. "Want a password"

- Overview: "passgen.zip" and "Encrypted.zip" are provided. "Encrypted.zip", which includes the flag, is locked with a secret password. The secret password is known to be generated by "passgen.zip" at some time between `2024/06/27 11:37:29` and `11:37:45 AM` in EST timezone. 

- Solution
    - Unzip passgen.zip and run passgen.exe opened a GUI like below:

    - Use dnSpy to disassemble passgen.exe file.

    - The disassembled source code was quite simple. There is a function called `button1_Click()` that is triggered when we click on the button `Generate Password`. Modify the function so that it continuously generates random passwords.

    - Save the changes and then set your local system time to `2024/06/27 11:37:00` for example. Please be careful with the timezone.
    - Start generating passwords until it ends.
    - After getting the list of passwords, I manually try one by one to open the locked .zip file (I can use Hydra or similar tools, but the small number of candidates didn't worth using the tools) and found the correct password.

### 2. "Gameboy Game"
- Overview: a Gameboy ROM was given. We are asked to score more than 32767 points to get the flag.

- Solution
    - On a Kali machine, I installed wine, downloaded bgb. Run `wine bgb64.exe` to start the bgb debugger.
    - Load the provided Gameboy ROM to bgb.

    - The game loaded. Open the "cheat searcher"
      
      <img width="1090" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/303155f1-8df7-4b70-9a5c-d52f0b93c4ec">

    - The challenge asks us to score more than 32767, hence the score should be 16 bits. Set `search value type` to `16 bits`. Click on `Start` to search for all 16 bits values in the app memory.

    - Score 1 point or 2, then press start (Enter) button to view the score and pause the game.

    - Open the cheat searcher again, set the target value as the score you earned above, and click `Search` to look for, among the list we got by the initial search, memory addresses of which value is the target value.

    - The `known` shrinks down a little bit (in the case of the screenshot below, it is 257). Continue this process until the list remains unchanged.
      
      <img width="491" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed8b6659-0a37-4ab2-9fea-837dc9e93b34">

    - The final result looks like this:
      
      <img width="485" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/373566e4-b6f6-461a-91a5-c8c8315a2366">

    - After this, the goal is to modify the memory where the score is stored so that our score is almost 32767. You can do that by right clicking on the address you want to view, select `go here in debugger`.
      
      <img width="490" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/096ccbda-720a-4dec-b945-d215fda3d1fb">

    - The value at `0xCB93` was the score at that time (2). The score turns out to be stored as a 16-bit signed integer at `0xCB93` and `0xCB94`
      
      <img width="730" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/459a7ee2-3cc0-49b4-95dd-bcbf6d108071">

    - Right clicking on the address you want to modify, select `Modify code/data`:
      
      <img width="742" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ef203fd-1dea-4b6a-980f-dcfa0b0df638">

    - Edit the memory such that `0xCB93 = ff` and `0xCB94 = 7f`. After that get back to the game, move the car to the arrow on the up left corner, and the flag appeared.

### 3. "Car game"
- Overview: a game written in SDL2 framework was provided. There was instructions on how should we run the game on Ubuntu 22.04 and the necessary libraries. We need to score more than 1337 points to get the flag.

- Solution:
    - I used GDB to debug the game and Ghidra to understand what
 
- The flag is:
