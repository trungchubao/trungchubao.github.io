``` As the captain of Team U-niverse, I participated to the Block Harbor x VicOne Automotive CTF Season 2 (2024). We couldn't make it to the final rounds. It was, however, a chance for us to learn new things. Personally, I was able to sharpen my reverse engineering skill a little bit. Here under I will place write-ups for the RE challenges that I solved. ```

### 1. "Want a password"

- Overview: "passgen.zip" and "Encrypted.zip" are provided. "Encrypted.zip", which includes the flag, is locked with a secret password. The secret password is known to be generated by "passgen.zip" at some time between `2024/06/27 11:37:29` and `11:37:45 AM` in EST timezone. 

- Solution
    - Unzip passgen.zip and run passgen.exe opened a GUI like below:

    - Use dnSpy to disassemble passgen.exe file.

    - The disassembled source code was quite simple. There is a function called `button1_Click()` that is triggered when we click on the button `Generate Password`. Modify the function so that it continuously generates random passwords.

    - Save the changes and then set your local system time to `2024/06/27 11:37:00` for example. Please be careful with the timezone.
    - Start generating passwords until it ends.
    - After getting the list of passwords, I manually try one by one to open the locked .zip file (I can use Hydra or similar tools, but the small number of candidates didn't worth using the tools) and found the correct password.
